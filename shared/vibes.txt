Help me create an interactive app that displays the SEO (meta) tags for any website in an interactive and visual way to check that theyâ€™re properly implemented.

The app should fetch the HTML for a site, then provide feedback on SEO tags in accordance with best practices for SEO optimization

The app should give google and Social media previews.

---

Make sure the website is responsive. The overall score with the circular progress should be center aligned. Text shouldn't overflow. Modify the form input so I don't have to type "https://" everytime.

---

Please implement the export functionality, save as a pdf file. It should be formatted correctly so I am able to print it out.

---

Generate a README.md file for this project. Make sure to include sections for usage and any other relevant info needed to get started on running the project. Include project description, dependencies used (and their use), etc.

---

Remove database functionality and any other code that is not being used.

---

Can you make this application work on gh-pages? If so, make any changes neccesary to make this work.

---

It throws the following error: "Failed to analyze URL: Failed to fetch URL: HTTP 500"

Make sure that the web app is able to do the request properly. It should work with gh-pages (GitHub Pages)

---

Show me in this chat how I would be able to publish the web app build into the gh-page branch properly. I want the script so I can add it into my package.json

---

gh-page deployment is successful, but the page isn't loading. The error is: "/SEOAnalyzer/src/main.tsx net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)"

---

When I run the test locally node scripts/test-gh-pages.js, it shows this error:
"""
rest-express/rest-express/src/main.tsx:1
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
"""
